# Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes is a Greek word which means `helmsman` or the pilot of a ship.

It is an open source project that was started by Google and derived from Borg, which is used inside Google — for several years now — for container management. Currently, it is hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes is an abstraction that optimizes the utilization of resources like CPU and memory through containers, which allow for efficient distributions of applications across a cluster of nodes. K8s can run anywhere on bare metal or in any cloud provider infrastructure.
